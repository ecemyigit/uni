/* Create a program that stores date of birth as a class object (you can use inheritance) and then check if the date is correct.
To fit our time limit, assume that every month can be 31 days long. For the year of birth, use the range from 1900 to 2021.
Make the exceptions in such a way, that it will be possible for the user to distinguish which part of the date is actually wrong. */
